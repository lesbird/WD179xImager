# WD179xImager
Disk imaging program for Heathkit Soft-Sector disks based on WD179x disk controller

Works together with the host software [H8DUtility3](https://github.com/lesbird/H8DUtility3) - these 2 projects will mostly stay in sync. Features added to WD179XImager will be supported by H8DUtility3 on the host PC.
